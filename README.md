## Simone Cervini - Politecnico di Milano

## Simple Virtual Tabletop Environment

### How to run - On Windows

To launch the platform Node JS must be installed first.

Install Node JS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install npm with: install.bat

After Node JS in installed the platform can be viewed by launching the backend and then the frontend.

Launch back end with: launch_backend.bat

Launch front end with: launch_frontend.bat

In alternative open the terminal in the folder backend and run the following commands:

> npm install

> npm run dev


Then open the terminal in the main folder and run the following commands:

> npm install

> npm start

### How to run - On Linux

To launch the platform Node JS must be installed first.

Install Node JS with the following commands:

> sudo apt-get update

> sudo apt-get install nodejs

> sudo apt-get install npm

After Node JS in installed the platform can be viewed by launching the backend and then the frontend.

Launch back end with the commands (open terminal in the 'backend' folder):

> node server.js

Launch front end with the commands (open terminal in the 'frontend' folder):

> npm start

Note: if any of the previous commands fail, try to reinstall nodjs and npm in each folder (backend and frontend)
